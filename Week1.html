                <p>
                    I thought the course introduction was clear and well thought out. Everyone got to know each other quickly. Introductions into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) were fun and interactive. I also enjoyed the Programming OO sessions and the pair programming sessions. most of the programming content we have covered so far has been basic bit it has re-inforced what I had already learned prior to my apprenticeship.
                </p>
                <h2>What didn't go well?</h2>
                <p>
                    I thing we could have been spending less time doing energiser and team bonding excersizes, after the first day you knew enough people that you could build on. The time may have been better spent doing longer programming OO sessions.
                </p>
                <h2>What did I learn? What am I looking forwards to?</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned how to publish my own website using github (<a href="https://dhunter87.github.io">Dans Website</a>). I learned about some design principles and also about personas and how to test them. This first week has mainly confirmed and re-enforced the things I had already learned prior to Ada. I'm really looking frowards to more in depth coding training.
