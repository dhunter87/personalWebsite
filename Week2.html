                <p>
                    Our final product and prototype turnued our very well and got good feedback. our final presentation also went very well.
                </p>
                <h2>What didn't go well?</h2>
                <p>
                    We could have worked better as a team. In my oppinion, we, as a team, missed a crucial part of the SDLC cycle (ideation, recap and ideation). We enfed the day without a valueable product to work with. As a result we ended up behind schedule, the new concept we came up with was not collaborative and it took a long time and a lot of effort for the team to re-align.
                </p>
                <h2>What did I learn? What am I looking forwards to?</h2>
                <p>
                    I learned that I can lead a team through a difficult moments when the team is not aligned. I learned that I should allow space for less dominant personalities to give theur input before myself for the benefit of the team. I also learned valuable presentation skills and gained valuable experience doing presentations.
