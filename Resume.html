                    <p>On completion of my recent work experience, the Head of Software Development at Sonovate left me a reference. Please find it on my LinkedIn profile.</p>
                    <p>
                        I worked in the motor vehicle industry for 15 years. I started with a work experience placement from school at an independent garage and worked my way up to a master technician for a well known multi franchise main dealership.
                        In my most recent employment, my main role was the day to day running of the workshop on the Fiat brand including work and time management, talking to customers to ensure all concerns were correctly handled, pre-ordering parts, warranty and recall work etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was in charge of all diagnostic work and quality checking the work of other technicians on the Fiat brand. I was also an MOT tester and AirCon technician and occasionally worked in the office as workshop controller.
